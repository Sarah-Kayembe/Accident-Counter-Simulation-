Introduction

This program entail 
	* using queue data structures to estimate the counters required for efficiently processing accident reports, 
	* with a focus on simulated report processing based on severity and time limitations. 
	* The activities attempt to master queue structures, 
	* sorting algorithms, and time complexity analysis, 
	* with outputs such as organized repositories and program files that provide estimations of the minimum required counters for specific counties.


How to Run

In Eclipse

1. Open Eclipse and import the project.
2. In the Project Explorer, locate the program4 class under accidentpack.
3. Right-click on program4 and select "Run As," then choose "Run Configurations."
4. In the "Run Configurations" window, go to the "Arguments" tab.
5. In the "Program arguments" section, enter the full file path as an argument.

Example:
/Users/sarahkayembe/Documents/COS285/AccidentsProcessing4/accidents.csv

6. Click "Run" at the bottom of the "Run Configurations" window.


Using Command Line (CMD)


1. Open CMD/terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.
2. Change directory to the ACCIDENTPACK folder.

For example:
/Users/sarahkayembe/Documents/COS285/AccidentsProcessing4/src/accidentpack

3. Compile all Java files using javac.

For example:
javac AccidentReader.java AccidentReport.java program4.java

4. Then cd..
5. Run the program using 'java'
For example:
java accidentpack.program4 /Users/sarahkayembe/Documents/COS285/AccidentsProcessing4/accidents.csv
